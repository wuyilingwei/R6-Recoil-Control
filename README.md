This guide explains how to use the Recoil Control application to manage weapon recoil settings and agent presets.

## File Structure

Ensure that the `Agents` and `presets` folders are in the same directory as the main script `main.py`.

```
Recoil-Control/
├── main.py
├── recoil_controller.py
├── settings.cfg
├── Agents/
│   ├── attackers/
│   └── defenders/
└── presets/
    ├── <agent_name>/
    └── ...
```

## How to Start the Application

To launch the application, run `main.py` or use the compiled executable [R6-Recoil-Control.exe](https://github.com/K1ngPT-X/R6-Recoil-Control/releases/download/v1.0.2/R6-Recoil-Control.exe):

```bash
python main.py
```

## Core Features

### Recoil Control

*   **Enable/Disable Recoil**: The main button on the interface (`Disabled`/`Enabled`) toggles recoil control.
    *   **Red**: Recoil disabled.
    *   **Green**: Recoil enabled.
    *   Button and hover colors change dynamically.
*   **Adjust Recoil Values**:
    *   Use the **sliders** to visually adjust vertical (Y) and horizontal (X) recoil values for both primary and secondary weapons.
    *   You can also **click and type** values directly into the input fields next to the sliders for greater precision. Press `Enter` after typing to apply the change.
*   **Active Weapon**: The application automatically switches between primary and secondary weapon recoil control based on configured hotkeys.

### Settings

Click the "Settings" button to open the settings window:

*   **Hotkeys**:
    *   **Primary Weapon Hotkey 1 & 2**: Set the keys or mouse buttons to switch to the primary weapon. Click "Record" and press the desired key/button.
    *   **Secondary Weapon Hotkey 1 & 2**: Set the keys or mouse buttons to switch to the secondary weapon. Click "Record" and press the desired key/button.
*   **Secondary Weapon Enabled**: Check or uncheck this box to enable or disable recoil control for the secondary weapon.
*   **Shoot Delay**: Adjusts the delay between recoil corrections.
*   **Sensitivity**: Adjusts the overall sensitivity of recoil control.
*   **Max Movement**: Defines the maximum allowed movement for recoil correction.

Settings are automatically saved to the `settings.cfg` file whenever you make a change.

### Preset Management

Click the "Presets" button to open the preset management window:

1.  **Agent Selection**: Choose between "Attackers" or "Defenders" to view the list of agents. Click an agent's icon to manage their presets.
2.  **Manage Presets for Selected Agent**:
    *   **Save Preset**: Enter a name in the "Preset Name" field and click "Save Preset" to save the current recoil settings (X and Y for both weapons, and if secondary weapon is enabled) as a new preset for the selected agent.
    *   **Load Preset**: Select an existing preset from the "Load Existing Preset" dropdown and click "Load Preset" to apply these settings. A confirmation will be requested.
    *   **Delete Preset**: Select an existing preset from the dropdown and click "Delete Preset" to remove it. A confirmation will be requested.

## 🔍 Executable (.exe) Safety Verification

This project includes an executable (`.exe`) built using [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/), a widely-used packaging tool for Python projects. Although legitimate, executables created with PyInstaller may occasionally trigger **false positives** in less well-known antivirus software.

To ensure transparency, we conducted a full scan using [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/9b115cae757e2c7782f8bc991fba98fa3747fa12b7fcde01cca538c0176266f0). Here are the results:

### 🧪 Scan Summary:
| Status                  | Details                                                                 |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ✅ Safe on 54/56       | Confirmed clean by Microsoft Defender, Kaspersky, BitDefender, Avast, AVG, McAfee, Malwarebytes, and other major vendors. |
| ⚠️ False positives on 2  | Flagged by 2 lesser-known antivirus engines due to generic heuristics related to PyInstaller usage. |
| 📜 Detection rule        | Based on a [public YARA rule](https://github.com/bartblaze/Yara-rules) identifying PyInstaller-packaged files — **not actual malware**. |
